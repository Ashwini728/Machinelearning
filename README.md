Heart Disease Analysis<br>
Overview<br>
This project focuses on analyzing heart disease data using Python. The notebook employs data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning techniques to identify patterns and build predictive models for heart disease detection.

Features<br>
Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, data normalization, and encoding categorical variables.<br>
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizes key patterns and relationships in the data.<br>
Machine Learning: Builds and evaluates predictive models using classification algorithms.<br>
Evaluation Metrics: Includes accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for model performance.<br>

Requirements <br>
Python 3.8 or higher<br>
Jupyter Notebook<br>
Required Python libraries:<br>
pandas<br>
numpy<br>
matplotlib<br>
seaborn<br>
scikit-learn<br>
Install dependencies using:<br>

bash<br>
Copy code<br>
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn<br>
Dataset<br>
The dataset (heart_disease.csv) contains various health indicators such as age, cholesterol level, blood pressure, etc., and a target variable indicating the presence or absence of heart disease.<br>

Key Columns<br>
Age: Age of the individual.<br>
Sex: Gender of the individual.<br>
Cholesterol: Serum cholesterol levels.<br>
RestingBP: Resting blood pressure.<br>
Target: Indicates the presence (1) or absence (0) of heart disease.<br>

Results<br>
Insights derived from EDA provide an understanding of key risk factors.<br>
Machine learning models offer predictions for identifying heart disease with measurable accuracy.<br>
Future Work<br>
Incorporate advanced machine learning techniques such as ensemble models.<br>
Extend analysis with additional health metrics.<br>
Deploy the model as a web application.<br>
