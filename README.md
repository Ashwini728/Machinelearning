Heart Disease Analysis
Overview
This project focuses on analyzing heart disease data using Python. The notebook employs data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning techniques to identify patterns and build predictive models for heart disease detection.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, data normalization, and encoding categorical variables.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizes key patterns and relationships in the data.
Machine Learning: Builds and evaluates predictive models using classification algorithms.
Evaluation Metrics: Includes accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for model performance.

Requirements
Python 3.8 or higher
Jupyter Notebook
Required Python libraries:
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
Install dependencies using:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
Dataset
The dataset (heart_disease.csv) contains various health indicators such as age, cholesterol level, blood pressure, etc., and a target variable indicating the presence or absence of heart disease.

Key Columns
Age: Age of the individual.
Sex: Gender of the individual.
Cholesterol: Serum cholesterol levels.
RestingBP: Resting blood pressure.
Target: Indicates the presence (1) or absence (0) of heart disease.
Usage
Clone the repository or download the notebook:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/heart-disease-analysis.git
Open the Jupyter Notebook:
bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook heartdisease.ipynb
Execute the cells step by step to load the data, perform EDA, and build machine learning models.
Results
Insights derived from EDA provide an understanding of key risk factors.
Machine learning models offer predictions for identifying heart disease with measurable accuracy.
Future Work
Incorporate advanced machine learning techniques such as ensemble models.
Extend analysis with additional health metrics.
Deploy the model as a web application.
